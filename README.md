# **Netflix Clone**


Next.js app ***Netflix Clone*** allows you to view videos, also like or dislike them, and the viewed videos are displayed in a separate subsection.

First you will see the authorization page where you can login using the *magic link*. To log into the app you will need to enter your email.

After logging in, you will be taken to the main page of the app with various video sections.

Each card is clickable. By clicking on the card, you would be able to see more information about the video, watch it and also having the ability to like or dislike.

You can also go back to home and watch other video you like. All the videos you watch will be displayed in the *Watch it again* section, and the videos you liked will be saved in the *My List*.

This app is completely responsive and supporting desktop, tablet and mobile.

***
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
